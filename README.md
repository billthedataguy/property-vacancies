### Notes
    

Initially we were looking at using something like Postgres and SQL, and we could potentially return to that, but for now we're going to make a first attempt at this using SQlite in hopes that the project runs smoother and quicker. We'll just have to see if the idea expands if we won't need more data table relations, and we may, as this PMS software contains a lot of other useful contact points we could utilize.
